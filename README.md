## Qwik-shadcn: A Component Library for Qwik
Qwik-shadcn is an experimental component library for Qwik, inspired by the modular approach of shadcn. This repository aims to provide reusable UI components tailored for Qwik applications while adhering to Qwik best practices to the best of my abilities.

⚠️ Note: This is not a complete package and should not be considered a finished product. The repository provides the source code for developers looking to use or customize components for their Qwik projects. Much like shadcn, this is meant as a source code solution rather than a pre-built package.

Feel free to contribute to the project any way you want
